A python script to model the win probabilities for a game of one on one between Lebron James and Anthony Davis as described in the 10/23/2020 538 Riddler

The script can be found as james_davis_one_on_one_v2.py

The output of the script plotted in excel is shown below with linear fits to both win probabilities.

Solving the equations for their intersection shows that a Lebron stealing percentage of 33.3% affords equal probability of winning for each player.
